Abstract 
This project aims to create an advanced pre-trained model for spam email detection, as well as a thorough benchmark suite for the evaluation and comparison of spam detection models. The study tackles two significant issues: enhancing the precision of spam identification and creating a uniform assessment system for the domain. We hypothesize that utilizing advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques alongside a substantial and varied dataset of emails will enable us to develop a high-performing pre-trained model and a rigorous benchmark to enhance spam detection research. This work is significant for its potential to improve email security, establish a benchmark for evaluating various methodologies, and expedite advancements in spam detection technologies.

This repository houses the comprehensive project for developing an advanced pre-trained model and a thorough benchmark suite for email spam detection. The project aims to enhance the precision of spam identification and establish a uniform assessment system for the domain.
